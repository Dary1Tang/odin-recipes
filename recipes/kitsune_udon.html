        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The broth for this dish is very umami and slightly fishy with subtle notes of seaweed. 
            The noodles are springy and work perfectly with this dish. 
            The aburaage is soft and easy to eat, and contributes a lot of the dish's overall flavor. 
            This can be served with fish cakes as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ounce kombu (Japanese dried kelp)</li>
            <li>5 cups cold water</li>
            <li>¾ cup bonito flakes</li>
            <li>2 ounces aburaage (frozen, defrosted fried tofu cakes)</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons soy sauce, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 pound frozen udon noodles</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Break kombu into 2-inch pieces; this should equal about 2 cups, 
                loosely packed. Bring water and kombu to a gentle boil 
                in a medium saucepan over medium heat; boil for 5 minutes. 
                Remove from heat, then remove and discard kombu. 
                Sprinkle in bonito flakes and bring to a simmer over 
                medium heat, about 2 minutes. Once simmering, remove from heat, 
                strain, and discard solids. Place dashi back into the saucepan 
                and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place aburaage in a medium bowl. 
                Cover with hot water and let soak until light and fluffy, 
                about 5 minutes. Strain, allow to cool briefly until cool enough 
                to handle, and gently press aburaage with your hands to squeeze out any excess water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring 1 cup dashi, 1 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon mirin, 
                and sugar to a boil in another medium saucepan over medium-high heat. 
                Reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat and add the soaked aburaage. 
                Cook, covered, until the majority of the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes. 
                Flip aburaage halfway through.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring the remaining 4 cups of dashi to a gentle boil over medium heat. 
                Stir in salt, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 
                remaining 1 tablespoon mirin. Add frozen udon noodles; 
                cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until noodles have separated 
                and are tender yet firm to the bite, about 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide noodles and broth evenly into 2 bowls. 
                Top with seasoned aburaage and sliced scallions.
            </li>
