        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            I think the Okinawans got the slow food concept right on - 
            this was one of my favorite dishes growing up...shoyu pork...
            eaten over rice, or on top of soba. The soy sauce-marinated, 
            slow-cooked pork with just the right amount of sweet taste 
            (imagine Okinawan brown sugar) is pretty close to perfect...
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds whole pork belly</li>
            <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup mirin (Japanese sweet wine)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place pork belly into a large pot, 
                and cover with water about 1-inch above the pork. 
                Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, and simmer for 2 minutes. 
                Discard water and fill pot with fresh water about 1-inch above 
                the pork. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce 
                heat to a simmer. Cook until the pork begins to soften, about 
                1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the pork from the water, and place on a cutting board. 
                Allow pork to cool for a few minutes, then slice off the thick 
                skin and discard. Cut the remaining pork meat into 1-inch wide 
                slices. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, 1/2 cup water, mirin, ginger, 
                and garlic in a large saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. 
                Add the sliced pork belly, then bring to a boil again. Reduce heat to low, 
                and place a sheet of aluminum foil directly over the meat and sauce. 
                Simmer uncovered until the pork is tender, 30 to 45 minutes, 
                turning the pork several times to cook evenly.
