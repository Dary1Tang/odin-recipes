        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The basic Japanese soup that's given out as an appetizer at most Japanese restaurants. 
            Very mild, a bit salty, and a touch of tang. 
            It's a very improvisable recipe; most of the ingredients' quantities can be changed according to taste. 
            Use your favorite mushrooms in this recipe.

            <li>½ carrot, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon minced fresh garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chicken stock</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons beef bouillon granules</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped fresh shiitake mushrooms</li>

            <li>
                In a large saucepan or stockpot, combine the celery, onion, carrot, ginger, garlic, and a few of the mushrooms. 
                Add chicken stock, beef bouillon, and water. 
                Place the pot over high heat, and bring to a rolling boil. 
                When the mixture reaches boiling, cover, reduce heat to medium, 
                and cook for 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place all of the remaining mushrooms into a separate pot.
                When the boiling mixture is done, place a strainer over the pot with the mushrooms in it. 
                Strain the cooked soup into the pot with the mushrooms. 
                Discard strained materials.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve the broth with mushrooms in small porcelain bowls, 
                and sprinkle fresh chives over the top. 
                Use Asian soup spoons for an elegant effect.
